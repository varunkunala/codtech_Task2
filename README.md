# Student Grade Tracker Project Overview
1.*Objective*:<br>
* The goal of this project is to create a Python program that allows users to input grades for different 
 subjects or assignments.<br>
* It calculates the average grade, assigns a letter grade, and computes the GPA (Grade Point Average).<br>

2.*Features Implemented*:<br>
* User inputs grades for six subjects (English, Maths, Science, Social, Physics, and Biology).<br>
* The program calculates the average grade using the provided grades.<br>
* It assigns a letter grade based on the average.<br>
* It converts the average grade to GPA using predefined ranges.<br>

3.*Components*:<br>
* Input Collection: The program prompts the user to input grades for each subject.<br>
* Average Calculation: It computes the average grade across all subjects.<br>
* GPA Calculation: It converts the average grade to GPA using predefined ranges.<br>

4.*Additional Information*:<br>
* The program displays the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.<br>
* It also calculates the percentage based on the average grade.<br>

5.*Next Steps*:<br>
* You can further enhance the program by adding features like weighted grades, student names, and a graphical 
  user interface (GUI).<br>
